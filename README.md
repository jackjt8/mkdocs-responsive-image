## Quick start

If you want to try this plugin as-it-is, follow these steps:

1. Download this repo and (eventually) unzip it in a folder

2. Inside the project folder, execute the command 
   `python setup.py develop` to install 
   the plugin on your local machine. 

3. Go to your mkdocs project folder, edit the `mkdocs.yml` file 
   and add these few lines at the end:

   ```yaml
   plugins:
       - responsive-image
   ```
